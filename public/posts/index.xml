      <description>So for the past some day i have been trying to find some project ideas. In my mind the project should be something that people around me can use and especially me.&#xA;Given that i went over multiple sources to find project ideas include product hunt and the ProjectBook (this helped alot). After going through these sources i was got three ideas&#xA;A social media website A forum A journaling/note taking or management app Now one thing is clear that the app must first be something that I , myself would like to use or even need to use.</description>
