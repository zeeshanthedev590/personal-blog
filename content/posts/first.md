Hi everyone,

I'm Zeeshan Khalid, and I'm really excited to welcome you to my blog! I'm a student from Pakistan, working on my A-levels and dreaming of studying at MIT someday. I love coding, but I also have a big passion for storytelling through filmmaking and photography.

In this blog, I'll be sharing my journey as I try to blend my love for technology with my creative side. I'll post updates on my coding projects, share my progress in game development, and give you a peek into my life through vlogs. I'll also talk about my experiences with photography and filmmaking, and share any tips and lessons I pick up along the way.

I hope you'll join me on this adventure. Whether you're interested in coding, storytelling, or just curious about my journey, I'm glad to have you here. Let's learn and create together!

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat.
